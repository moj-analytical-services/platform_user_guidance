# Working with big datasets and sharing them: Accessing data in Amazon S3

[Amazon S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) is used as the
primary storage area for large data files. In contrast to files in your
personal home directory, files in S3 can be accessed by multiple
Platform users. You will be only be able to access buckets that you have been granted access to (see [User Administration][User Administration]).

## Importing data from S3 into R

There are currently two methods of browsing and importing data held in S3 into RStudio.

### User Interface

We have developed a user interface that allows you to search and browse the files that you have been given access to.

You can install the package as follows:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moj-analytical-services/s3browser")
```

See the [documentation](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/s3browser) for
further details.


### Command line tool

We have also developed a command line tool that provides you with
some helper function. This enables you to do things like write
`read_s3_csv` to read directly from S3 into a data frame in R.

You can install this package as follows:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moj-analytical-services/s3tools")
```
See the [documentation](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/s3tools) for
further details.
