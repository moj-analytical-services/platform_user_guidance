# Working with big datasets and sharing them: Accessing data in Amazon S3

[Amazon S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) is used as the primary storage area for large data files. In contrast to data in your Platform's home directory, data in S3 can be accessed by multiple Platform users. You will only be able to access S3 buckets (folders) that you have been granted access to (see [User Administration][User Administration]).

## Importing data from S3 into R

There are currently two methods of browsing and importing data held in S3 into RStudio.

### User Interface

We have developed a user interface that allows you to search and browse the files that you have been given access to.

You can access this interface by typing the following command into your R Studio console:
```r
s3browser::file_explorer_s3()
```

See the [documentation](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/s3browser) for further details.

### Command line tool

We have also developed a command line tool that provides you with some helper function. This enables you to do things like write `s3tools::s3_path_to_full_df("alpha-everyone/CW iris.xlsx")` to read directly from S3 into a data frame in R.

See the [documentation](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/s3tools) for
further details.

## Uploading data to S3

### Where data is stored

Data in s3 is stored in 'buckets', which are conceptually very similar to folders. 

An S3 bucket is automatically created for every team that's created in Github; for how to create and manage teams see [User Administration][User Administration]. By default, all members of a Github team have **read and write** access to their corresponding bucket.

### Uploading data

To access the buckets you need to visit the Amazon management console with the following link: https://alpha-analytics-moj.eu.auth0.com/samlp/NpfImg4P3ynU6HFx7ivYmqUZWQHfwi3Y (if you regularly upload data it may be worth bookmarking this link).

Authentication is managed by GitHub, so if this is the first time you are connecting to the Amazon S3 Management console you may have to approve it.

You'll be able to see all buckets, **including** those you **do not** have access to.  You can only see the _contents_ of buckets to which you have access.

To upload data, find the bucket you want to upload data to. Within the bucket you can create folders and upload files by following the on screen instructions. When uploading files **you will be prompted to set the settings for that file**. If this happens, the default settings are okay.

#### Step-by-step instructions

1. Use the following [link](https://alpha-analytics-moj.eu.auth0.com/samlp/NpfImg4P3ynU6HFx7ivYmqUZWQHfwi3Y) to login

2. Select the S3 service

3. Select the bucket you wish to upload data to (the bucket will have the same name as the team, but spaces are replaced with `-` and all letters are lower case, so `Test Team` will have a bucket called `test-team`). While in **alpha** all buckets will also have the alpha prefix.

   You'll notice two buckets are created; **use the one prefixed `alpha-`** and ignore the one prefixed `dev-`.

   **The easiest way is to use the search**:

4. Use the interface to **create folders** or **upload files**. Note: The default settings are fine.

#### Manipulating data

You can also move, rename and delete data using the S3 management console. Select the files by checking the text box, use the `More` button so see the options.
