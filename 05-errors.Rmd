# Common Errors and Sollutions 
## Failed to lock directory

This error is typically encountered after a failed package install. 

**Error**
```
ERROR: failed to lock directory ‘/home/robinl/R/library’ for modifying
Try removing ‘/home/robinl/R/library/00LOCK-readr’
```

**Solution**

Run the following:
```r
install.packages('pacman')
pacman::p_unlock()
```

If that does not work, or if you have trouble installing the `pacman` package, try the following:

>Go to 
>Tools -> Shell
>and type:
>
>`rm -rf /home/robinl/R/library/00LOCK-readr`
>
>See [here](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/rm1.html) for more details.  Be careful with the `rm` command!

## Unable to access data using `aws.s3` package.

Unfortuntely `aws.s3` does support the granular file access permission model we are using on the platform.  Specifically, it is unable to automatically provide the user with the right file access credentials.  We provide `s3tools` as a solution to this problem, which manages your credentials for you.

We recommend that, where possible, users should use `s3tools`.  Where this is not possible, include a call to `s3tools::get_credentials()` prior to making the call to `aws.s3`, and this will guarantee that fresh credentials are generated before your call to `aws.s3`
