# About this guidance {-}

Note that this guidance covers user interactions that are unique to the platform.  We do not provide guidance on how to use off-the-shelf tools like R Studio and Git as high quality training materials are available online for free, and training and coaching is also provided within Analytical Services Directorate.

Some online training recommendations are provided throughout.

### Platform is in early development {-}
The platform is being actively developed. We have given early access to the platform in order to receive feedback from the users. Please get in contact to **tell us what you like, what you don’t like, and what doesn’t work**.  

For bugs and problem reports, please raise a ticket via Github, [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/analytics-platform/issues).

For immediate support, contact us by [email](mailto:robin.linacre@digital.justice.gov.uk), or on the `#analytical_platform` [Slack channel](https://asdslack.slack.com/messages/anaytical_platform/)

If you find any issues with the guidance, please report them [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/platform_user_guidance/issues).
