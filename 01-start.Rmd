# Getting Started

This section details each step you must perform to get setup on the platform.

## Getting an account
### Sign up for github
In order to provide you with an account on the platform, we require your Github username. If you do not already have an account, head to https://github.com/ and sign up. When signing up, use all the default options.

If you already have a personal Github account, it will be easiest to just use that. We recommend new users use their `@justice` email address, but note that it'â€™'s also fine for your account to be attached to a personal email address.

### Enable two-factor authentication on your Github account
Once you've signed to Github, you must enable two factor authentication to enhance security. You can do this in your Github [settings page](https://github.com/settings/security).

You are given the option of doing this using SMS, or an authentication appsuch as [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) . Choose whichever you prefer. Save a copy of your recovery codes, for example by emailing them to your secure government email address.

For step-by-step instructions, see the Github guidance for [authentication apps](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/) or [SMS authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-text-message/).

### Email us your Github username
Once you've got a Github account setup, email your github username to [Leanne Mills](mailto:leanne.mills@digital.justice.gov.uk) (or [Robin Linacre](mailto:Robin.Linacre@justice.gsi.gov.uk) if she's out of office) who will create your Analytical Platform account.

### Read the Security Operating Procedure

Before you start using the platform, please read the [Acceptable use policy](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/platform_user_guidance/acceptable-use-policy-security-operating-procedures.html).  

## Accessing your platform instance

The Analytical Platform team will email you when your platform account has been set up, with details of how to access you account.

If you lose this information, you can access your platform account at a personalised link, dependent on your Github user name.
For example, if your github username is `moj1234` your platform will be available at `https://moj1234-rstudio.tools.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz`.  

When you first access your platform account, you will be asked to set up two factor authentication for the platform itself.  You must do this using an authentication app on your personal or work phone (such as [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en)).  There is no SMS option.

For troubleshooting 2FA issues, please see [this section](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/platform_user_guidance/blob/master/05-errors.Rmd#two-factor-authentication-problems) of the user guidance.

##  Configuring Git and Github for use on the Analytical Platform

Github enables you to collaborate with colleagues on code and share you work with them.  It puts your code in a centralised, searchable place. It also enables you to version control your work.  

If you are new to Git and Github, it is worth clarifying the difference between Git and Git**hub**. Git is the software that looks after the version control of code, whereas Github is the website on which you publish and share your version controlled code. In practice this means you use Git to track versions of your code, and then submit those changes to Github.

This guide runs through how to set up connectivity between your Analytical Platform account and Github.  This is a one-time set up procedure; you only need to do this once, when you first use the platform.

This page covers only the initial setup.  For guidance on how to use Git to sync your work with Github, please see the information [here](http://happygitwithr.com/) or [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#git-rstudio).   We have also published a suggested working pattern [here](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards/blob/master/version_control_pattern.md).

You can find more detailed notes about setting up Git with R Studio [here](http://adamwilson.us/RDataScience/GitSSHNotes.html) and [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)

### Instructions

The overview is as follows:

1. Create an 'SSH key' within your platform R Studio.  This is an unique code that is stored in your account. Having the key means you will not need to enter your password when interacting with Github.
2. Register the key with Github.
3. Configure git to use your username and email address.

#### Step 1 - create an SSH key

You can create your SSH key within the platform:

`Tools` -> `Global options` -> `Git/SVN` -> `Create RSA key...`

You will be presented with dialog showing your key fingerprint, amongst other details.  You do not need this information, therefore close the window:

![](images/start/git_close.PNG)

For the next step, you'll need to copy and paste your SSH public key.  You can copy this to the clipboard using the following dialogues:

![](images/start/git_view_public.PNG)

![](images/start/git-public-key.PNG)

You can find more information about SSH keys in [this](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) guidance.  

#### Step 2:  Register the key with Github.

The next step is to register your SSH public key with Github, using the interface on [www.github.com](https://www.github.com).  This guidance assumes you have copied your public key to your computer's clipboard in the previous step.

First, navigate to the Github homepage.  If you are not logged in already, you will need to log in.

Access your settings from the menu that appears when you click on your profile picture in the top right.  Once in settings, access your SSH and GPG keys.  [Here's](https://github.com/settings/keys) a direct link.

![](images/start/github_settings.PNG)

Click on `New SSH key`.

![](images/start/github_new_ssh.PNG)

Paste your key into the dialogue that pops up and click `Add SSH key`. You can choose any name you like for the 'title' of the key.

The link with Github and the Analytical Platform is now established. You can now return to the analytical platform.

3. Configure your Git name and email address within the analytical platform.

To start syncing your work with Github, Git needs to know a bit more about you.

Within the platform, access the shell using `Tools` -> `Shell...`

Then, you need to type the following commands (substitute your name and email):

```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
git config --global user.email 'your@email.com'
```

You're now ready to start using Github!
