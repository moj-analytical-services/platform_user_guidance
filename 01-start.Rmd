# Getting Started

This section will detail each step you need to go through to get setup on the  platform.

## Getting an account
### Sign up for github
In order to provide you with an account on the platform, we require your github username. If you do not already have an account, head to https://github.com/ and sign up. When signing up, use all the default options.

If you already have a personal Github account, it will be easiest to just use that. We recommend new users use their @justice email address, but note that it’s also fine for your account to be attached to a personal email address.

### Enable two-factor authentication.
Once you’ve signed up, you must enable two factor authentication. This is what enables us to store OFFICIAL data in the platform. You can do this in your Github [settings page](https://github.com/settings/security).

You are given the option of doing this via SMS or an authentication app (such as [Authy](https://authy.com/download/) or [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en)) - choose whichever you prefer.

For step-by-step instructions see the Github guidance for [authentication apps](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-a-totp-mobile-app/) or [SMS authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication-via-text-message/).

### Email us your Github username

Once you've got a Github account setup, email you account name [Robin Linacre](mailto:Robin.Linacre@justice.gsi.gov.uk) and [Leanne Mills](mailto:leanne.mills@digital.justice.gov.uk) who will create your Analytical Platform account.

### Read the Security Operating Procedure

Before you start using the platform, please read the [Security Operating Procedures][Security Operating Procedures].  

## Accessing your platform instance

As part of the signup process you will have created a github account. The location of your analytical platform instance is dependent on this- for example, if your github username is `moj1234` your platform will be available at `https://moj1234-rstudio.tools.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz`.

##  Configuring Git and Github for use on the Analytical Platform

If you are new to Git and Github it is worth clarifying the difference between Git and Git**hub**. Git is the software that looks after the version control of code, whereas Github is the website that hosts that version controlled code. In practise this means that using Git to track versions of your code and then submit those changes to Github.

This guide runs through how to set up connectivity between your Analytical Platform account and Github.  This is a one-time set up procedure that you only need to do once when you first use the platform.

Github enables you to collaborate with colleagues on code and share you work with them.  It puts your code in a centralised, searchable place. It also enables you to version control your work.  

This page covers only the initial setup.  For guidance on how to use Git to sync your work with Github, please see the following guidance [TODO:  Insert basic Git guidance].

You can find more detailed notes about setting up Git with R Studio [here](http://adamwilson.us/RDataScience/GitSSHNotes.html) and [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN)

### Instructions

The steps are as follows:

1. Create an 'SSH key' within the platform.  This is an unique code that will be stored in your account, meaning you will not need to enter your password when interacting with Github.
2. Register the key with Github.
3. Configure git to set you username and password.



#### Step 1 - create an SSH key

You can create your SSH key within the platform-  

Tools -> Global options -> Git/SVN -> Create RSA key:

You will be presented with dialog showing your key fingerprint, amongst other details.  You do not need this information, therefore close the window:

![](images/start/git_close.PNG)

For the next step, you'll need to copy and paste your SSH public key.  You can copy this to the clipboard using the following dialogues:

![](images/start/git-public-key.PNG)

You can find more information about SSH keys in [this](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/) guidance.  

#### Step 2:  Register the key with Github.

The next step is to register your SSH public key with Github, using the interface on [www.github.com](https://www.github.com).  This guidance assumes you have copied your public key to your computer's clipboard in the previous step.

First, navigate to the Github homepage.  If you are not logged in already, you will need to log in.

Access your settings from the menu that appears when you click on your profile picture in the top right.  Once in settings, access your SSH and GPG keys.  [Here's](https://github.com/settings/keys) a direct link.

Click on 'New SSH key'.

Paste your key into the dialogue that pops up and click 'Add SSH key'. You can choose any name you like for the 'title' of the key.

The link with Github and the Analytical Platform is now established. You can now return to the analytical platform.

3. Configure your Git name and email address within the analytical platform.

To start syncing your work with Github, Git needs to know a bit more about you.

Within the platform, access the shell using Tools -> Shell...

Then, you need to type the following commands (substitute your name and email):

```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your Name'
git config --global user.email 'your@email.com'
```

You're now ready to start using Github!
