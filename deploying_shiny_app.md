# How to deploy your Shiny apps on the Analytical Platform

The following steps to deploy a Shiny app are as follows

1. Copy the [template project](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-example) within Github to a new repository, with a name of your choosing
2. In R Studio, start a new project from version control (file -> new project -> version control -> git).   TODO:  Remember to make sure the template has a Rproj that enables packrat
3. Work on your Shiny app, using the template `ui.R` and `server.R` files.  
4. When you're ready to share it, access the [Services control panel](https://jenkins.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/), find your app, and click 'Build now'
5. Once deployed, grant users access to the app by inserting their names into the [Grant user access control panel](https://controlpanel.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/).
