# Building a Shiny app that you can deploy on the Analytical Platform

The following steps to deploy a Shiny app are as follows:

1. Copy the [template project](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-example) within Github to a new repository, with a name of your choosing
2. In R Studio, start a new project from version control (file -> new project -> version control -> git).   TODO:  Remember to make sure the template has a Rproj that enables packrat
3. Work on your Shiny app, using the template `ui.R` and `server.R` files.  
4. Ensure that your package dependencies are snapshotted using `packrat::snapshot()`
4. When you're ready to share it, access the [Services control panel](https://jenkins.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/), find your app, and click 'Build now'
5. Once deployed, grant users access to the app by inserting their names into the [Grant user access control panel](https://controlpanel.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/).


Further details are below:

For advanced users, the guidance [here] (TODO:  Add advanced guidance covering app.R etc.) discusses customisability and options for deployment.  Refer to this guidance if you're already familiar with git, packrat etc.

## 1. Copy the template project into a new Github repository

Begin by making a copy of the R Shiny template project.  

![](images/import_repository.PNG?raw=true  "")

Enter `https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-template` in the input box entitled 'Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL':

![](images/repo_clone_url.PNG?raw=true  "")

Ensure the 'owner' of the new repository is 'moj-analytical-services' and choose a name for your repository:

![](images/name_copied_repo.PNG?raw=true  "")

Make sure the repo is 'private' (this should be the default value):

![](images/repo_private.PNG?raw=true  "")

and then click 'Begin import'

![](images/begin_import.PNG?raw=true  "")


## 2. In R Studio in the platform, create a new project from your new Github repository

In R Studio, navigate through the following menus:

File -> New project -> Version control -> Git)

TODO:  Add screenshot of dialogue

In 'Repository URL', enter the URL of the repository you just created.  This needs to be the SSH URL (starting with `git@github`), **NOT** the HTTPS url (which starts with `https`).  It is therefore in the following format:

```
git@github.com:moj-analytical-services/your_name_goes_here.git
```

R Studio will create a new project folder for you with all the template files in.  

You can now start building your Shiny app by editing `server.R` and `ui.R` files.

### Further notes for if you're having trouble finding your new repo's url

If you navigate to your new repository's home page (which will have a url in the form `https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/your_name_goes_here`), you can use the following buttons to access this url (make sure you click the 'ssh' button):

![](images/use_ssh.PNG?raw=true  "")

![](images/ssh_url.PNG?raw=true  "")


## 3. Work on your app

You can now work on your Shiny app in R Studio as normal.  As you work, commit your changes to Github using your chosen Github workflow.

## 4. Snapshot dependencies using packrat

Your Shiny app will have dependencies on various third-party R packages (e.g. `dplyr`).  These packages change through time, and sometimes these changes are not backwards compatible.  When we deploy you Shiny app, it is therefore essential to include a manifest of all of the package dependencies and their specific versions. 

The R package`packrat` automates this process.  Before deploying your app, you need to call `packrat::snapshot()` to auomatically create this manifest.  You will then probably want to call `packrat::clean()` to remove any dependencies which are no longer in use.

This creates a file called `packrat/packrat.lock`.  You need to ensure you have committed this to the Github repository prior to deployment

## 5. Scan organisation and deploy

The platform automatically scans git repositories in the [moj-analytical-services](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/) Github organiastion to find repos which are ready to deploy.  It does this by checking whether repositories contains two 'magic' files which control deployment:  `Jenkinsfile` and `Dockerfile`.

To deploy your app, go [here](https://jenkins.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/job/moj-analytical-services-github/).  

You will see a list of apps which have been detected.  Find yours and click on the link:

![](images/deploy_jenkins_interface.PNG?raw=true  "")

Then click on the branch you wish to deploy (this will usually be 'master'):

![](images/deploy_jenkins_branch.PNG?raw=true  "")

Finally, click 'Build':

![](images/deploy_jenkins_build.PNG?raw=true  "")

## 6. Grant secure access to the app

Users are granted access to the app using a list of email addresses separated with a space, comma, or semicolon.

To grant access, complete the form [here](https://controlpanel.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/job/grant-access-to-app/build?delay=0sec), and press 'Build'.

For example, your form might look like this:

![](images/grant_access_email.PNG?raw=true  "")

NOTE:  Any characters which are not alphanumerics or dashes are converted into dashes.
