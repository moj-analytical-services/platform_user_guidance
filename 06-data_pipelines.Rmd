# Data pipelines

## Summary

Deploy your data processing code to the cloud. Airflow is a tool on the Analytical Platform that is a managed place for your "data pipeline" to run. This can be useful, for example, to:
* run a long job overnight
* run it on a regular schedule (e.g. every night)
* when multiple outputs require the same intermediate result, it can be calculated once for them all
* people other than yourself can see the job and its output (compared to if you run it in your R Studio or Jupyter)
* you keep a history of all the job runs, showing what you ran, the logs, what tasks failed and how long it took

## Concepts

* A "data pipeline" is referred to in Airflow as a "DAG". It is made up of "tasks" which are arranged into a Directed Acyclic Graph.
* A "DAG" is a Directed Acyclic Graph. This could be simple: Task 1 -> Task 2 -> Task 3 (meaning run Task 1 then Task 2 then Task 3). Or a Task can be dependent on multiple previous Tasks, and when its complete it can trigger multiple Tasks. The "Acyclic" bit just means you can't have loops.
* Each "task" is a GitHub repository, containing code files that will be run (e.g. R or python) plus bits that define the environment it runs in - a Dockerfile and an AWS IAM policy.
* You define the DAG to run on a regular schedule, and/or you can run it by clicking the "Play" button on the Airflow web interface

## Details

### Task repo

Each task should be a repository:

* It should be under the https://github.com/moj-analytical-services organization
* The name of the repo is recommended to start with `airflow-`

The repo should include:

1. deploy.json - This is for Concourse to build the repo into a Docker image

    e.g.
    ```
    {
        "mojanalytics-deploy": "v1.0.0",
        "type": "airflow_dag",
        "role_name" : "airflow-enforcement-data-processing"
    }
    ```
    The version number does nothing?! The `role_name` needs to be unique to the Analytical Platform and be prefixed `airflow-`.

2. iam_policy.json - This tells Concourse to create an AWS role that gives your code permission to access AWS resource, such as data in S3 buckets. 

    e.g. See: https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/airflow-enforcement-data-engineering/blob/master/iam_policy.json
for listing, reading and writing to S3 buckets.

### Build the image

Concourse will:

* build your GitHub repository into a Docker image
* upload the Docker image to a private location in AWS Elastic Container Registry

To trigger Concourse, make sure your code is committed and pushed to GitHub and then [create a release on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). Call the first release `v0.0.1`, then `v0.0.2` etc. The version should always go up in number, or it won't build. It's good practise to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Concourse starts the build within 30 seconds and takes 5 minutes to an hour. You can track progress and see any errors like this:
1. Open Concourse: https://concourse.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/
2. Select team 'main'
3. Click 'login with ap-main' followed by your GitHub login and possibly 2FA for GitHub and possibly 2FA for AP.
4. Click the hamburger icon (top-left) to see the list of repos that can be built.
5. Click on a repo name to see its diagram with the big 'Deploy' box in the middle, inputs and outputs. Click on the 'Deploy' box to see details of the most recent build. Green colours means it passed. Red means it had an error and didn't complete. You can see previous builds (numbered - e.g. "8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1").

### Airflow DAG

You need to define a DAG of your Tasks, so that Airflow can run it.

A DAG is defined in its own .py file in the [https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/airflow-dags](airflow-dags repository). Normally you would clone the repo, add the new DAG file, commit it to a branch and create the Pull Request. You can achieve this in R Studio, Jupyter or on your local machine if you have git, and then use GitHub to create the Pull Request. Alternatively you could simply click the "Create new file" button in GitHub and use the web interface to edit it and create a pull request in one go!

Use an existing DAG as an example: https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/airflow-dags/blob/master/mags_curated.py

The `image` is the address of the Docker image - look in the Concourse build log:

    successfully tagged ...

Tip: Before you commit, run the file with python to check the python syntax is ok. If it gets as far as giving you import errors then you know the python syntax is ok. (If you can be bothered to install the python libraries you could run it all)

Merging the Pull Request needs to be done by the ASD Data Engineering team, to ensure the IAM permissions are acceptable.

The DAG will appear in the Airflow web interface a couple of minutes after the Pull Request is merged.

### Airflow web interface

The Airflow web interface allows you to see the data pipelines running, view the logs, see past runs, etc.
