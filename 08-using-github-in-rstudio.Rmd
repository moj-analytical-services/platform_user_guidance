# Using Github with R Studio

Github enables you to collaborate with colleagues on code and share you work with them.  It puts your code in a centralised, searchable place. It also enables you to version control your work.  

This guide provides a step-by-step run through of how to create a project and sync your work with Github.  You can find more in-dept Git training resources [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/platform_user_guidance/getting-started.html#training-resources)

## Step 1 - Create a new project ('repo') in Github

This is conceptually similar to setting up a folder on the shared drive to save your work in.
