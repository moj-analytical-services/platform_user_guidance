# Using Github with R Studio

Github enables you to collaborate with colleagues on code and share you work with them.  It puts your code in a centralised, searchable place. It also enables you to version control your work.  

This guide provides a step-by-step run through of how to create a project and sync your work with Github.  You can find more in-dept Git training resources [here](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/platform_user_guidance/getting-started.html#training-resources)

## Step 1 - Create a new project ('repo') in the moj-analytical-services Github page

This is conceptually similar to setting up a folder on the shared drive to save your work in.  

First, navigate to www.github.com and make sure you're logged in.

Then he following gif shows you what you need to do:

## Step 2:  Navigate to your platform R Studio and check out the project

Follow the steps in this gif:

Notes:

* When you copy the link to the repo from Github, ensure you use the ssh link, which start `git@github.com` as opposed to the https one, which start `https://github.com/`
  
## Step 3: Edit your files, 'stage' the changes, and then commit them.  

Each commit creates an 'undo point' on in your personal files on the Platform.  You can can always revert back to this point.  

Each commit would typically include changes to a number of different files, rather than the single file shown in the gif.

Note that 'commiting' does not sync your changes with github.com.

 ## Step 3: 'Push' (sync) your work with github.com
