[Amazon S3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) is used as the primary storage area for large data files.  In contrast to files in your personal home directory, files in S3 can be accessed by multiple Platform users.  

## Accessing files from S3 in R

We are working on a GUI to make it easy to navigate 

In the meantime we have developed an R package that provides you with some helper function.  This enables you to do things like write `read_s3_csv` to read directly from S3 into a data frame in R.

You can install this package as follows:  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("moj-analytical-services/s3tools")
```

See the [documentation](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/s3tools) for further details.
