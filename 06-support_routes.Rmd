# How to get Support

Key Points:

* Step by step (what is the process you should go through)
    + Built in support (e.g. for R try looking at package guides and functions, for github...?, for platform look at user guidance) 
    + Google/stack overflow
    + 


* Platform Support
    + Platform team (MOJ Digitech) is only there to 
    + Slack channel link   



* R-support
    + R slack channel
    + Stack overflow/Google
    + Package guidance
    + R training group
    + Data Science team - last resort, if exhausted the others (need reproducable example, see below)



* Git-support
    + Git slack channel
    + Git training course
    + Data science team - again last resort, 



* Creating a reproducable example
    + Minimal example
    + Cut out any large data, use R-datasets if possible (mtcars etc.)
    + Reproduce the problem with a clear input, line of code etc.
    


* Raising Issues
    + Github issue pages
    + Package specific issues (github also)
    + Guidance for how to structure issues
