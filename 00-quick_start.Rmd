# Quick Start

Read this if you're new to the tools on the platform or require a quick introduction as to how they fit together.

## What is the Analytical Platform?

The Platform provides four main services to analysts:
- Accesss to analytical software.
- Data storage and access to datasets.
- The ability to build and deploy interactive data products and websites.
- Collaboration tools for analysts that enable teams to work concurrently on complex analytical projects.

Note that the below list contains **links to those services**. I recommend bookmarking them.

- **R Studio:** Allows you to write R code. You can read in data from Amazon S3, and save (refered to as a "commit") your code to Github. When using the platform, you'll spend the bulk of your time in R Studio.

- [**Amazon S3:**](https://alpha-analytics-moj.eu.auth0.com/samlp/NpfImg4P3ynU6HFx7ivYmqUZWQHfwi3Y) Cloud file storage where you can upload secure data to folders (called "buckets"), with no limit on storage space.
- [**Jenkins:**](https://jenkins.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/) Automates the process of publishing your developed web content (stored in Github) to the web.
- [**Github:**](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services) Primarily a place to store and collaborate on projects (code), but also used to create teams who have shared access to data and code.

## Why should I use the Analytical Platform?

The Platform provides a number of advantages over existing analytical infrastructure:

- It provides access to the latest versions of modern analytical software, such as R Studio,
- It provides greater computational resources (12Gb RAM and fast CPUs) than DOM1 machines.
- It can be accessed from multiple computer systems - DOM1, Quantum (HMPPS's system), and Macbooks. 
- It allows analysts to securely deploy data products such as R Shiny applications and javascript data visualisations.
- The platform is hosted in the cloud, which means it is scalable.  Data storage is unlimited, and computational resource can be scaled to demand.

##  FAQ: How do I?

This section covers common tasks you may want to complete on the platform. If we've missed something then let us know.

##### Get access to the platform{-}

See [Getting Started][Getting Started].

##### Share data or code with a team{-}
If you haven't set up a team yet, see [User Administration][User Administration].
If you've got a team but want to upload data see [Uploading data to S3][Uploading data to S3].
If you want to share code see guidance on [Github][Configuring Git and Github for use on the Analytical Platform].


##### Upload and work with data{-}

If the data isn't shared and is <100mb you can upload it directly to R Studio.

If you want to share the data or if its >100mb you'll need to [set up a team][User Administration], then upload data see [Uploading data to S3][Uploading data to S3].

To import data from S3 into R for analysis see [Importing data from S3 into R][Importing data from S3 into R].

##### Make an interactive dashboard and deploy it securely{-}

See [Deploying a Shiny App ][Deploying a Shiny App ].
