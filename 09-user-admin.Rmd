# User Administration

## Teams and data access groups

We updated the [control panel](http://cpanel-master.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/) on 4th May 2018.  You can now manage data access groups directly in the control panel.  Github teams no long have any effect on data access permissions.

We are working on updating the documentation, which will appear here when complete.
