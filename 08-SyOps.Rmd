# Acceptable Use Policy (Security Operating Procedures)

- You must not put any sensitive (OFFICIAL) data into the platform without getting permission from [Robin Linacre](mailto:robin.linacre@digital.justice.gov.uk) or get in contact on the `#analytical-platform` channel on Slack.
- The platform is still in Beta, which means we cannot guarantee its stability.  Please do not use the platform for time-critical tasks.  Specifically, you need to be prepared for the eventuality of downtime, which could last up to a week. 
- If you are responsible for a team, ensure that users have the [correct permissions][Team member permissions].


## General security guidance
- Do not access the platform from your personal (i.e. home) computer.
- Choose a complex password for your Github account that cannot be guessed.  For further advice, see [here](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/three-random-words-or-thinkrandom-0)
- You must not share your account with anyone else. 


## Guidance on the use of Github

The advice in this document relates to private repositories which are part of the [MoJ Analytical Services organisation](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/) only.  You **must not** store OFFICIAL work in public repositories unless you are sure it is not sensitive and have permission from your line manager.

### What can I use GitHub for?

You may use GitHub to store your analytical code at OFFICIAL level.  This means that you can use Git for work where the code itself is sensitive, such as work on court or prison closures.

You may also use GitHub to store project writeups, so long as the write ups do not contain information or data which would violate the prohibitions on the use of GitHub set out below.

### Prohibitions: What canâ€™t I use GitHub for?

In general, you must not use GitHub to store datasets.  Specifically, you **MUST NOT** use GitHub for the following purposes:

* To store any large datasets classified at OFFICIAL or above. Our working definition is that a large dataset contains over 1,000 records.

* To store any data whatsoever (in code or in datasets) where individuals are potentially identifiable and the data is not already in the public domain.  

* To store credentials such as usernames and passwords, or secrets such as database connection strings.
