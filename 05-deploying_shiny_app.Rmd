# Deploying a shiny app

## Basic deployment

### Summary

To create and deploy a Shiny app, you should follow these steps:

1.  Copy the app template
2.  Create a new webapp
3.  Clone the repository
4.  Develop the app
5.  Manage dependencies
6.  Set access permissions
7.  Create a release in GitHub
8.  Deploy in Concourse
9.  Add users to the app
10. Access the app

### Copy the app template

1.  Go to [github.com/new/import](https://github.com/new/import).
2.  Enter `https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-template` in the field titled 'Your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL'.
3.  Select `moj-analytical-services` as the owner of the new repository.
4.  Add a name for the new repository.
5.  Set the privacy of the new repository to private.
6.  Select 'Begin import'.

### Create a new webapp

Standard users are not able to create new webapps or webapp data sources themselves.

To create a new webapp or webapp data source, ask the Analytical Platform team on the [#ap_admin_request Slack channel](https://asdslack.slack.com/messages/CBLAGCQG6/) or by [email](mailto:analytical_platform@digital.justice.gov.uk), if you are a Quantum user.

You should provide the URL of the app's GitHub repository as well as any existing webapp data sources it should be connected to.

### Clone the repository

1.  Navigate to the app's repository on GitHub.
2.  Click 'Clone or download'.
3.  Ensure that the dialogue says 'Clone with SSH'. If the dialogue says 'Clone with HTTPS' select 'Use SSH'.
4.  Copy the SSH URL.
5.  In RStudio, select 'File' > 'New project...' > 'Version control' > 'Git'.
7.  Paste the SSH URL in the 'Repository URL' field.
8.  Select 'Create Project'.

### Develop the app

Develop the app in RStudio.

Your app can take one of several forms:

1.  A directory containing `server.R`, plus, either `ui.R` or a www directory that contains the file `index.html`.
2.  A directory containing `app.R`.
3.  An `.R` file containing a Shiny application, ending with an expression that produces a Shiny app object.
4.  A list with `ui` and `server` components.
5.  A Shiny app object created by `shinyApp`.

By default, the template contains `server.R` and `ui.R` files, however, you may wish to take a different approach depending on your requirements. For example, using `app.R`, it is possible to deploy Shiny apps from within a package, as [here](https://github.com/RobinL/costmodelr/blob/b328902026bd1cce5d17b487e310c59725ea4d62/R/shiny_explorer.r#L20).

### Manage dependencies

Most apps will have dependencies on various third-party packages. Changes to these packages may not always be backwards-compatible. To avoid compatibility issues and ensure reproducible outputs, it is necessary to use a package management system, such as packrat or conda.

If using packrat, ensure that it is enabled for your project in RStudio.

To enable packrat, select 'Tools' > 'Project Options...' > ' Packrat' > 'Use packrat with this project'.

When packrat is enabled, run `packrat::snapshot()` to generate a list of packages used in the project, their sources and their current versions.

You may also wish to run `packrat::clean()` to remove unused packages from the list.

The list is stored in a file called `packrat/packrat.lock`. You must ensure that you have committed this file to GitHub before deploying your app.

### Set access permissions

You can set some access permissions for your app in the `deploy.json` file.

The `allowed_ip_ranges` parameter controls where your app can be accessed from. It can take any combination of the following values `["DOM1", "QUANTUM", "102PF WiFi"]` or `["Any"]`.

The `disable_authentication` parameter controls whether sign-in is required for users to access the app. It can take the values `true` or `false`. In general, this should be set to `false`. If you wish to disable authentication, you should first discuss this with the Analytical Platform team.

### Create a release in GitHub

1.  To create a release in GitHub, navigate to the app's repository.
2.  Select 'release' > 'Draft a new release'.
3.  Choose a tag version for the release. GitHub provides tagging suggestions at the right of the screen that we advise you to follow.
4.  Choose a title for the release.
5.  Describe the contents of the release.
6.  Select 'Publish release'.

### Deploy in Concourse

Once you have created a release in GitHub, Concourse should automatically start to deploy your app within a few minutes.

If your app does not deploy automatically, you should first check that the pipeline is not paused.

If the app still does not deploy automatically, you can manually trigger a build by pressing the `+` icon in the top right corner of Concourse.

### Add users to the app

If `disable_authentication` is set to `false` in the `deploy.json` file, access to the app will be controlled by email address. You can ask the Analytical Platform team to add or remove users to the access list on the [[#ap_admin_request Slack channel](https://asdslack.slack.com/messages/CBLAGCQG6/) or by [email](mailto:analytical_platform@digital.justice.gov.uk), if you are a Quantum user.

### Access the app

Your deployed app can be accessed at `repository-name.apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz`, where `repository-name` is the name of the relevant GitHub repository.

If the repository name contains underscores, these will be converted to dahses in the app URL. For example, an app with a repository called `repository_name` would have the URL `repository-name.apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz`.

When accessing an app, you can choose whether to sign in using an email link (defult) or a one-time passcode. To sign in with a one-time passcode, add `/login?method=code` to the end of the app's URL.

## Advanced deployment

## Editing the Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

In most cases, you will not need to change the `Dockerfile` when deploying your app.

If your app uses packages that have additional system dependencies, you will need to add these in the `Dockerfile`. If you are unsure how to do this, contact the Analytical Platform team.

A `Dockerfile` reference can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

## Troubleshooting

### Common errors

Sometimes, a Shiny app can deploy successfully but result in the following error:
```{bash error, eval=FALSE}
An error has occurred
The application failed to start

The application exited during initialization
```
This is generic error that means there is an error in your R code or there are missing packages.

To try to fix this you should:

*   explicitly reference all third-party packages using the double colon operator (i.e. use `shiny::hr()` as opposed to `hr()`);
*   ensure that you have called `packrat::snapshot()` and committed `packrat.lock` to GitHub, if using `packrat`.

In general, it is also good practice to:

*   minimise the number of packages you use in your project;
*   test your app early and often; and
*   test using a cloned copy of the app's repository to avoid issues arising as a result of uncomitted local changes.

### Packrat

If you are having issues with `packrat.lock`, follow these steps:

1.  Delete the entire `packrat` directory.
2.  Comment out all code in the project.
3.  Enable packrat using `packrat::init()`.
4.  Capture all package dependencies using `packrat::snapshot()`.
5.  Uncomment all code in the project and install package dependencies one by one.
5.  Rerun `packrat::snapshot()`.
6.  Redeploy the app.

### Kibana

All logs from deployed apps can be viewed in [Kibana](https://kibana.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz).

To view all app logs:
1.  select 'Discover' from the left sidebar; then
2.  select 'Open' from the menu bar; then 
3.  select 'Application logs (alpha)' from the saved searches.

To view the logs for a specific app:
1.  select 'Add a filter'; then
2.  select 'app_name' as the field; then
3.  select 'is' as the operator; then
4.  insert the app name followed by '-webapp' as the value; then
5.  click 'Save'.

Log messages are displayed in the 'message' column.

By default, Kibana only shows logs for the last 15 minutes. If no logs are available for that time range, you will receive the warning 'No results match your search criteria'.

To change the time range, select the clock icon in the menu bar. There are several presets or you can define a custom time range.

Kibana also has experimental autocomplete and simple syntax tools that you can use to build custom searches. To enable these features, select 'Options' from within the search bar, then toggle 'Turn on query features'.

### Deploying locally

If you have a MacBook, you can use Docker locally to test and troubleshoot your Shiny app. You can download Docker Desktop for Mac [here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac).

To build and run your Shiny app locally, follow these steps:

1.  Clone your app's repository to a new folder on your MacBook. This guarantees that the app will be built using the same code as on the Analytical Platform.
2.  Open a terminal session and navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile`.
3.  Build the Docker image using:
    ```{bash docker build, eval=FALSE}
    docker build . -t <image tag>
    ```
    where `image tag` is a tag you want to give the image.
4.  Run a Docker container created from the Docker image using:
    ```{bash docker run, eval=FALSE}
    docker run -p 80:80 <image tag>
    ```
5.  Go to [127.0.0.1:80](127.0.0.1:80) to view the app.

If the app does not work, follow these steps:

1.  Start a bash session in a Docker container created from the Docker image using:
    ```{bash docker bash run, eval=FALSE}
    docker run -it -p 80:80 <image tag> bash
    ```
2.  Install the `nano` text editor using:
    ```{bash install nano, eval=FALSE}
    apt-get update
    apt-get install nano
    ```
3.  Open `shiny-server.conf` using:
    ```{bash open conf, eval=FALSE}
    nano /etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf
    ```
4.  Add the following lines at the beginning of `shiny-server.conf`:
    ```{bash add lines, eval=FALSE}
    access_log /var/log/shiny-server/access.log tiny;
    preserve_logs true;
    ```
5.  Write the changes by pressing `Ctrl+O`.
6.  Exit the `nano` text editor by pressing `Ctrl+X`.
7.  Increase the verbosity of logging and start the Shiny server using:
    ```{bash increase verbosity, eval=FALSE}
    export SHINY_LOG_LEVEL=TRACE
    /bin/shiny-server.sh
    ```
8.  Open a new terminal session.
9.  Start a new bash session in the Docker container using:
    ```{bash run bash, eval=FALSE}
    docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash
    ```
    You can find the `CONTAINER ID` by running `docker ps`.
10. View the logs using:
    ```{bash view logs, eval=FALSE}
    cat /var/log/shiny-server/access.log
    ```
