We do not provide guidance on how to use off-the-shelf tools like R Studio and Git as high quality training materials are available online for free, and training and coaching is also provided within Analytical Services Directorate. Some online training recommendations are provided throughout. Platform is in ALPHA development The platform is being actively developed. We have given early access to the platform in order to receive feedback from the users. Please get in contact to tell us what you like, what you don’t like, and what doesn’t work. You can do this by email, on the #analytical_platform Slack channel, or via Github. Reporting problems If you find any issues with the guidance, please report them here. "],
["getting-started.html", "Part 1 Getting Started 1.1 Getting an account 1.2 Accessing your platform instance 1.3 Configuring Git and Github for use on the Analytical Platform 1.4 Before you start writing code 1.5 Training Resources", " Part 1 Getting Started This section will detail each step you need to go through to get setup on the platform. 1.1 Getting an account 1.1.1 Sign up for github In order to provide you with an account on the platform, we require your github username. If you do not already have an account, head to https://github.com/ and sign up. When signing up, use all the default options. If you already have a personal Github account, it will be easiest to just use that. We recommend new users use their @justice email address, but note that it’s also fine for your account to be attached to a personal email address. 1.1.2 Enable two-factor authentication. Once you’ve signed up, you must enable two factor authentication. This is what enables us to store OFFICIAL data in the platform. You can do this in your Github settings page. You are given the option of doing this via SMS or an authentication app (such as Authy or Google Authenticator) - choose whichever you prefer. For step-by-step instructions see the Github guidance for authentication apps or SMS authentication. 1.1.3 Email us your Github username Once you’ve got a Github account setup, email you account name Robin Linacre and Leanne Mills who will create your Analytical Platform account. 1.1.4 Read the Security Operating Procedure Before you start using the platform, please read the Security Operating Procedures. 1.2 Accessing your platform instance As part of the signup process you will have created a github account. The location of your analytical platform instance is dependent on this- for example, if your github username is moj1234 your platform will be available at https://moj1234-rstudio.tools.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz. 1.3 Configuring Git and Github for use on the Analytical Platform If you are new to Git and Github it is worth clarifying the difference between Git and Github. Git is the software that looks after the version control of code, whereas Github is the website that hosts that version controlled code. In practise this means that using Git to track versions of your code and then submit those changes to Github. This guide runs through how to set up connectivity between your Analytical Platform account and Github. This is a one-time set up procedure that you only need to do once when you first use the platform. Github enables you to collaborate with colleagues on code and share you work with them. It puts your code in a centralised, searchable place. It also enables you to version control your work. This page covers only the initial setup. For guidance on how to use Git to sync your work with Github, please see the following guidance [TODO: Insert basic Git guidance]. You can find more detailed notes about setting up Git with R Studio here and here 1.3.1 Instructions The steps are as follows: Create an ‘SSH key’ within the platform. This is an unique code that will be stored in your account, meaning you will not need to enter your password when interacting with Github. Register the key with Github. Configure git to set you username and password. 1.3.1.1 Step 1 - create an SSH key You can create your SSH key within the platform- Tools -&gt; Global options -&gt; Git/SVN -&gt; Create RSA key: You will be presented with dialog showing your key fingerprint, amongst other details. You do not need this information, therefore close the window: For the next step, you’ll need to copy and paste your SSH public key. You can copy this to the clipboard using the following dialogues: You can find more information about SSH keys in this guidance. 1.3.1.2 Step 2: Register the key with Github. The next step is to register your SSH public key with Github, using the interface on www.github.com. This guidance assumes you have copied your public key to your computer’s clipboard in the previous step. First, navigate to the Github homepage. If you are not logged in already, you will need to log in. Access your settings from the menu that appears when you click on your profile picture in the top right. Once in settings, access your SSH and GPG keys. Here’s a direct link. Click on ‘New SSH key’. Paste your key into the dialogue that pops up and click ‘Add SSH key’. You can choose any name you like for the ‘title’ of the key. The link with Github and the Analytical Platform is now established. You can now return to the analytical platform. Configure your Git name and email address within the analytical platform. To start syncing your work with Github, Git needs to know a bit more about you. Within the platform, access the shell using Tools -&gt; Shell… Then, you need to type the following commands (substitute your name and email): git config --global user.name &#39;Your Name&#39; git config --global user.email &#39;your@email.com&#39; You’re now ready to start using Github! 1.3.2 Git training resources If you are new to github we recommend that you complete the basic tutorial available here. Using Github with R Introductory interactive tutorial. Quickstart guide and cheatsheet here and in pdf format here. More in depth materials: Learn Git branching Git from the inside out 1.4 Before you start writing code Please read the coding standards. 1.5 Training Resources The data science team maintain a list of R training here.

In contrast to files in your personal home directory, files in S3 can be accessed by multiple Platform users. You will only be able to access buckets that you have been granted access to (see User Administration). 2.1 Importing data from S3 into R There are currently two methods of browsing and importing data held in S3 into RStudio. 2.1.1 User Interface We have developed a user interface that allows you to search and browse the files that you have been given access to. You can install the package as follows: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;moj-analytical-services/s3browser&quot;) See the documentation for further details. 2.1.2 Command line tool We have also developed a command line tool that provides you with some helper function. This enables you to do things like write read_s3_csv to read directly from S3 into a data frame in R. You can install this package as follows: install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) devtools::install_github(&quot;moj-analytical-services/s3tools&quot;) See the documentation for further details. 2.2 Uploading data to S3 2.2.1 Where data is stored An S3 bucket is automatically created for every team; for how to create and manage teams see User Administration. By default, all members of the team have read and write access to the bucket. 2.2.2 Uploading data In Amazon S3 storage areas are refered to as ‘Buckets’. To access the buckets you need to visit the Amazon management console with the following link: https://alpha-analytics-moj.eu.auth0.com/samlp/NpfImg4P3ynU6HFx7ivYmqUZWQHfwi3Y (if you regularly upload data it may be worth bookmarking this link). Authentication is managed by GitHub, so if this is the first time you are connecting to the Amazon S3 Management console you may have to approve it. You’ll be able to see all buckets, including those you do not have access to. To upload data, find the bucket you want to upload data to. Within the bucket you can create folders and upload files by following the on screen instructions. When uploading files you will be prompted to set the settings for that file. If this happens, the default settings are okay. 2.2.2.1 Step-by-step instructions Use the following link to login Select the S3 service Select the bucket you wish to upload data to (the bucket will have the same name as the team, but spaces are replaced with - and all letters are lower case, so Test Team will have a bucket called test-team). While in alpha all buckets will also have the alpha prefix. The easiest way is to use the search: Use the interface to create folders or upload files. Note: The default settings are fine. 2.2.2.2 Manipulating data You can also move, rename and delete data using the S3 management console. Select the files by checking the text box, use the More button so see the options. "],
["building-a-shiny-app-that-you-can-deploy-on-the-analytical-platform.html", "Part 3 Building a Shiny app that you can deploy on the Analytical Platform 3.1 Step-by-step guide to deplying an app 3.2 Accessing the app 3.3 Advanced deployment", " Part 3 Building a Shiny app that you can deploy on the Analytical Platform The following steps to deploy a Shiny app are as follows: Copy the template project within Github to a new repository, with a name of your choice. In R Studio, start a new project from version control (file -&gt; new project -&gt; version control -&gt; git). TODO: Remember to make sure the template has a Rproj that enables packrat Work on your Shiny app, using the template ui.R and server.R files. Ensure that your package dependencies are snapshotted using packrat::snapshot() When you’re ready to share it, access the Services control panel, find your app, and click ‘Build now’. Once deployed, grant users access to the app by inserting their names into the Grant user access control panel. Step-by-step instructions are below. For advanced users, the guidance here discusses customisability and options for deployment. Refer to this guidance if you are already familiar with git, packrat etc. 3.1 Step-by-step guide to deplying an app 3.1.1 Copy the template project into a new Github repository Begin by making a copy of the R Shiny template project. Enter https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-template in the input box entitled ‘your old repository’s clone URL:’ Ensure the ‘owner’ of the new repository is ‘moj-analytical-services’ and choose a name for your repository: Make sure the repo is ‘private’ (this should be the default value): Click ‘Begin import’ 3.1.2 In R Studio in the platform, create a new project from your new Github repository In R Studio, navigate through the following menus: File -&gt; New project -&gt; Version control -&gt; Git In ‘Repository URL’, enter the URL of the repository you just created. This needs to be the SSH URL (starting with git@github), NOT the HTTPS url (which starts with https). Therefore, it is in the following format: git@github.com:moj-analytical-services/your_name_goes_here.git R Studio will create a new project folder with all the template files in. You can now start building your Shiny app by editing server.R and ui.R files. 3.1.2.1 Further notes if you’re having trouble finding your new repo’s url If you navigate to your new repository’s home page (which will have a url in the form https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/your_name_goes_here), you can use the following buttons to access this url (make sure you click the ‘ssh’ button): 3.1.3 Work on your app You can now work on your Shiny app in R Studio as normal. As you work, commit your changes to Github using your chosen Github workflow. 3.1.4 Snapshot dependencies using packrat Your Shiny app will have dependencies on various third-party R packages (e.g. dplyr). These packages change through time, and sometimes these changes are not backwards compatible. When we deploy your Shiny app, it is therefore essential to include a manifest of all of the package dependencies and their specific versions. The R packagepackrat automates this process. Before deploying your app, you need to call packrat::snapshot() to automatically create this manifest. You may want to call packrat::clean() to remove any dependencies that are no longer in use. This creates a file called packrat/packrat.lock. You need to ensure you have committed this to the Github repository prior to deployment. 3.1.5 Scan organisation and deploy The platform automatically scans git repositories in the moj-analytical-services Github organisation to find repos that are ready to deploy. It does this by checking whether repositories contains two ‘magic’ files that control deployment: Jenkinsfile and Dockerfile. To deploy your app, go here. You will see a list of apps that have been detected. Find yours and click on the link with its name (if you’re app isnt listed then click “Scan Organisation Now” on the left hand menu and wait for the scan to complete.) Then click on the branch you wish to deploy (this will usually be ‘master’) Finally, click ‘Build’ 3.1.6 Grant secure access to the app Users are granted access to the app using a list of email addresses separated with a space, comma or semicolon. To grant access, complete the form here, and press ‘Build’. For example, your form might look like this: NOTE: Any characters which are not alphanumeric or dashes are converted into dashes. 3.2 Accessing the app Only users who you have granted access to will be able to access your app - the url for the app will be the respository-name followed by apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz. So for the example project above “test-shiny-project”, the deployment url will be https://test-shiny-project.apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz. Users will be prompted to enter their email and, if they are on the approved list, be sent a access link to view the app. 3.3 Advanced deployment This section contains guidance for advanced users on app deployment. 3.3.1 What is run when I deploy a Shiny app? When you deploy an app, the R Shiny server runs shiny::runApp() within the project. This is equivalent to when you press ‘run’ in a R Shiny project within R Studio. To understand how you can use this to deploy apps of different types, we can refer to the runApp docs. Specifically, the ‘arguments’ section is useful: Arguments appDir The application to run. Should be one of the following: A directory containing server.R, plus, either ui.R or a www directory that contains the file index.html. A directory containing app.R. An .R file containing a Shiny application, ending with an expression that produces a Shiny app object. A list with ui and server components. A Shiny app object created by shinyApp. One of those options is A directory containing app.R., which should contain: An .R file containing a Shiny application, ending with an expression that produces a Shiny app object.. This gives the developer a wider range of options of how to deploy a Shiny app, and makes it possible to deploy shiny apps that are bundled into pre-existing packages e.g. see here. 3.3.2 Can I change my build? Yes - if you know Docker, you are welcome to change the Dockerfile. "],

["user-administration.html", "Part 5 User Administration 5.1 Teams and data access groups", " Part 5 User Administration 5.1 Teams and data access groups Users, teams and data access are all managed from Github Teams. Every team is automatically granted an S3 Bucket (a shared storage area). Teams and the associated S3 Bucket can be used in two ways: As as a shared area for a team. As “data access groups” where each member of the Github “team” is cleared to access a given dataset. For how to access buckets from within R see here. 5.1.1 Team creation See Githubs Guidence for a step-by-step guide on how to setup teams. A list of teams can be found here. 5.1.1.1 Team name When creating a team, make sure that the name of the team is clear, concise, and unique. Particularly as this will be the name of the folder where the associated data will be stored. Team names may contain spaces, but we recommend that you_use_underscores or you-use-dashes instead. Teams can either be teams or data access groups. If a bucket contains a core data set then it should be uploaded to a data access group and not a team shared storage area. In practise, individuals will probably be members of multiple teams and data access groups. Importantly, data access groups should be prefixed DAG_team_name. 5.1.1.2 Team visability Teams can be visable or secret. Visible teams can be viewed by all members of the organisation (those who are on Github but not on your team), whereas secret teams can only be viewed by members of that team. 5.1.1.3 Troubleshooting: I can’t create teams You will only be able to add team members that are part of the organisation. As part of the setup process users should already be added to the organisation. If they’re not then email Robin Linacre or Leanne Mills. 5.1.2 Adding or removing users from a team Step-by-step guidance on how to add or remove team members is available on Github. Note that when a user is added they are also authorised to access the data. Similarly, when they are removed, access to the data is revoked. 5.1.3 Team member permissions Members of a team can be Maintainers or Members. See the Github Guidance on how to set permissions for team members. Maintainers have the following additional permissions, and can be thought of as team administrators: Change the team’s name and description Change the team’s visibility Add organization members to the team Remove organization members from the team Promote an existing team member to team maintainer Remove the team’s access to repositories Reinstate a former organization member "],
