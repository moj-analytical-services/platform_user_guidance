# Deploying a Shiny App

The following steps to deploy a Shiny app are as follows:

1. Copy the [template project](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-example) within Github to a new repository, with a name of your choice.
2. In R Studio, start a new project from version control (file -> new project -> version control -> git).   TODO:  Remember to make sure the template has a Rproj that enables packrat
3. Work on your Shiny app, using the template `ui.R` and `server.R` files.  
4. Ensure that your package dependencies are snapshotted using `packrat::snapshot()`
5. When you're ready to share it, access the [Services control panel](https://jenkins.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/), find your app, and click 'Build now'.
6. Once deployed, grant users access to the app by inserting their names into the [Grant user access control panel](https://controlpanel.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/).

Step-by-step instructions are below.

For advanced users, the guidance [here][Advanced deployment] discusses customisability and options for deployment.  Refer to this guidance if you are already familiar with git, packrat etc.

## Step-by-step guide to deplying an app

### Copy the template project into a new Github repository

1. Begin by making a copy of the R Shiny template project.  

2. Enter `https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-template` in the input box entitled 'your old repositoryâ€™s clone URL:'

3. Ensure the 'owner' of the new repository is 'moj-analytical-services' and choose a name for your repository:

4. Make sure the repo is 'private' (this should be the default value):

5. Click 'Begin import'

### In R Studio in the platform, create a new project from your new Github repository

In R Studio, navigate through the following menus:

File -> New project -> Version control -> Git

In 'Repository URL', enter the URL of the repository you just created.  This needs to be the SSH URL (starting with `git@github`), **NOT** the HTTPS url (which starts with `https`). Therefore, it is in the following format:

```
git@github.com:moj-analytical-services/your_name_goes_here.git
```

R Studio will create a new project folder with all the template files in.  

You can now start building your Shiny app by editing `server.R` and `ui.R` files.

#### Further notes if you're having trouble finding your new repo's url

If you navigate to your new repository's home page (which will have a url in the form `https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/your_name_goes_here`), you can use the following buttons to access this url (make sure you click the 'ssh' button):

### Work on your app

You can now work on your Shiny app in R Studio as normal.  As you work, commit your changes to Github using your chosen Github workflow.

### Snapshot dependencies using packrat

Your Shiny app will have dependencies on various third-party R packages (e.g. `dplyr`).  These packages change through time, and sometimes these changes are not backwards compatible.  When we deploy your Shiny app, it is therefore essential to include a manifest of all of the package dependencies and their specific versions.

The R package`packrat` automates this process.  Before deploying your app, you need to call `packrat::snapshot()` to automatically create this manifest.  You may want to call `packrat::clean()` to remove any dependencies that are no longer in use.

This creates a file called `packrat/packrat.lock`.  You need to ensure you have committed this to the Github repository prior to deployment.

### Scan organisation and deploy

The platform automatically scans git repositories in the [moj-analytical-services](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/) Github organisation to find repos that are ready to deploy.  It does this by checking whether repositories contains two 'magic' files that control deployment:  `Jenkinsfile` and `Dockerfile`.

To deploy your app, go [here](https://jenkins.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/job/moj-analytical-services-github/).  

1. You will see a list of apps that have been detected.  Find yours and click on the link with its name (if you're app isnt listed then click "Scan Organisation Now" on the left hand menu and wait for the scan to complete. This step may take a few minutes.)

2. Then click on the branch you wish to deploy (this will usually be 'master')

3. Finally, click 'Build'

### Grant secure access to the app

Users are granted access to the app using a list of email addresses separated with a space, comma or semicolon.

To grant access, complete the form [here](https://controlpanel.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/job/grant-access-to-app/build?delay=0sec), and press 'Build'.

For example, your form might look like this:

![](images/shiny/jenkins_email.gif)

NOTE:  Any characters which are not alphanumeric or dashes are converted into dashes.  



## Accessing the app

Only users who you have granted access to will be able to access your app - the url for the app will be the `respository-name` followed by `apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz`.

So for the example project above "test-shiny-project", the deployment url will be `https://test-shiny-project.apps.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz`.

Users will be prompted to enter their email and, if they are on the approved list, be sent a access link to view the app.

## Advanced deployment

This section contains guidance for advanced users on app deployment.

### What is run when I deploy a Shiny app?

When you deploy an app, the R Shiny server runs `shiny::runApp()` within the project.  This is equivalent to when you press 'run' in a R Shiny project within R Studio.

To understand how you can use this to deploy apps of different types, we can refer to the `runApp` [docs](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/runApp.html).  Specifically, the 'arguments' section is useful:

```
Arguments
	appDir	The application to run. Should be one of the following:
		A directory containing server.R, plus, either ui.R or a www directory that contains the file index.html.
		A directory containing app.R.
		An .R file containing a Shiny application, ending with an expression that produces a Shiny app object.
		A list with ui and server components.
		A Shiny app object created by shinyApp.
```

One of those options is `A directory containing app.R.`, which should contain: `An .R file containing a Shiny application, ending with an expression that produces a Shiny app object.`.

This gives the developer a wider range of options of how to deploy a Shiny app, and makes it possible to deploy shiny apps that are bundled into pre-existing packages e.g. see [here](https://github.com/RobinL/costmodelr/blob/b328902026bd1cce5d17b487e310c59725ea4d62/R/shiny_explorer.r#L20).

### Can I change my build?

Yes - if you know Docker, you are welcome to change the
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/rshiny-template/blob/master/Dockerfile).
